# PalThrow (v1.6.4)

**PalThrow** is a gameplay mod for **PEAK** that lets you throw other players who stand on top of you. Just hold **X** while someone is standing on your head to charge up, and release to launch them in the direction you are looking!

ALL PLAYERS MUST HAVE THE MOD TO BE THROWN.

## Features

- Charge up throws using stamina  
- Force depends on how long you charge  
- If you keep on charging while out of stamina you fall unconscious for a short while - watch out!
- Fully network-synced in multiplayer  

## Configuration

You can tweak throw strength, stamina cost, and charge time through the BepInEx config file (`BepInEx/config/com.lamia.palthrow.cfg`).  
You can also change the Throwing Key in case you don't want to use **X**

## Installation

1. Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) for **PEAK**
2. Drop the `PalThrow.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`
3. Launch the game â€” you're ready to throw!
